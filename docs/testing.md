# NHS prototype kit: Testing

Each bit of the kit should be covered with automated tests.

To run all the tests, run:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Code style tests

There are also some tests to check that the code follows a style guide.

To run these checks run:

```sh
npm run lint
```

You can also automatically fix any code style issues by running:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```
